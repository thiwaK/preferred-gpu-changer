# Preferred GPU Changer

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
This application operates dynamically and applies changes only while it is running, either in the foreground or background. Once the application is closed, all changes will automatically revert to their default settings.

### ‚ú® Background
With the release of the Windows 10 May 2020 Update (20H1), Microsoft altered how users can select a GPU for specific applications. As a result, the familiar "Run with graphics processor" option was removed from the NVIDIA Control Panel and the right-click context menu.

Now, to force an application to use a specific GPU, users must:
1. Open Windows **Display Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Graphics Settings** under **Advanced Display Settings**.
3. **Browse** for the application's executable file.
4. **Select** the application and click **Options** to open the GPU selection window.
5. **Choose** the preferred **GPU** and save the settings.

While this method works, it is tedious, especially if you need to frequently switch GPUs for different applications.

To simplify this process, I developed an application that restores the **"Run with graphics processor"** option to the right-click context menu. This tool allows you to select the GPU directly from the context menu, just like before.

### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The Preferred GPU Changer application works by directly modifying the Windows Registry to set the GPU preference for a specific application.

The application checks the current GPU preference for the specified application by querying the Windows Registry:
* It opens the registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DirectX\UserGpuPreferences`.
* It searches for the application name within the registry values and checks the GPU preference associated with it.

The possible GPU preference values are:
- `GpuPreference=1`: Integrated GPU
- `GpuPreference=2`: Discrete GPU

If no preference is found, it defaults to `GpuPreference=0`, which means the system chooses automatically.

Once the current GPU setting is retrieved, the application sets the new GPU preference by adding a new registry entry or modifying the existing one. After updating the GPU preference, the application is then launched. Once the application closes, the original GPU setting is restored to its previous state.
