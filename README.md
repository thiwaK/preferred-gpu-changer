# Preferred Graphics Processor Changer (Run with graphics processor)

In the Windows 10 May 2020 Update (20H1), the way to select which graphics processor to use for applications has changed. The "Run with graphics processor" option is no longer available in the NVIDIA Control Panel or the context menu. To force Windows to use a different GPU for an application, you now need to go to the Windows display settings and browse for the executable file for the application. Then, you need to click on the Options button to bring up the GPU select window and choose the desired GPU.

I have developed a simple application that simplifies this process. It restores the "Run with graphics processor" option to the context menu, so you can easily choose which GPU to use for any application.

## Instructions

To install the application, download the installer from the releases page. Once the installer is downloaded, run it and follow the on-screen instructions. The application will be installed and you can start using it right away.


## Note

The changes made by this application will only take effect while the application is running, whether in the background or foreground. When the application is terminated, the changes will automatically revert to their original values.
